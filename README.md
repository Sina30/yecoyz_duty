# Features
All of the features our script have and all the possibilities.

- A sleek, modern, and easy-to-use interface designed for a smooth user experience. Easily see which players are online or offline, and whether they are on or off duty. You can also quickly access their phone numbers for easy communication, as well as view their rank within your company or organization.

- History: View how many hours youâ€™ve worked with filters such as all-time, day, week, and month. You can also see the number of shifts and the average time per shift.

- Managing Workers system: This allows the boss or chief of a company to view all employees and monitor their work performance, including shifts, total work time, and average shift duration.

- Multiplier System: Rewards players for working longer shifts and staying active on duty. The more you work, the higher your multiplier grows. However, going off duty will gradually decrease the multiplier over time.
